# Inspiredby-website

Overview
## A fully functional Inspired By project built with React, demonstrating how a service-focused company can effectively present its competency-based methodology, engage both individuals and organizations, and guide users through an empowering digital experience. 

This project was created alongside a YouTube series that walks through building custom hooks, routes, and reusable structures.
Every part of this project includes sample code showing how to: 

* Build a modern, responsive frontend using React and Vite 
* Architect a scalable folder structure with reusable UI components 
* Present structured service data and methodology steps using dynamic React components
* Validate and handle form submissions through API or email services 
* Implement client-side routing with React Router for smooth navigation
* Improve performance through code splitting, image optimization, and caching
